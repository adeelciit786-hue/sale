## The Real Issue

**Your Python 3.14 installation is corrupted.**

The app won't run until you fix this. There's no workaround.

## ✅ FIX IT NOW (15 minutes)

### Read This First
→ Open: **FIX_NOW.md** (2-minute read)

### Then Follow These Steps
→ Open: **PYTHON_FIX.md** (detailed step-by-step guide)

### Steps Summary:
1. **Uninstall** Python 3.14
2. **Download** Python 3.12
3. **Install** Python 3.12 (CHECK the PATH box!)
4. **Restart** your computer
5. **Verify**: `python --version`
6. **Run**: `.\run_app.bat`

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After these steps:
- ✅ Python will work
- ✅ Virtual environment will create
- ✅ App will start
- ✅ Access: http://localhost:5000

## 📌 IMPORTANT

**Do NOT skip the "Add Python to PATH" step during installation.**

This is why it's not working. Without it, Python won't be accessible.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always use run_app.bat** - It handles everything automatically
2. **Don't manually create venv** - The scripts do it for you
3. **Check error messages** - They tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Read the relevant .md file** - It probably has your solution
5. **Try deleting venv** - If things break badly, delete venv folder and try again

---

## 🆘 Emergency Troubleshooting

### If completely stuck:
1. Delete `venv` folder completely
2. Run `run_app.bat` again
3. This recreates everything fresh

### If Python won't cooperate:
1. Read `PYTHON_FIX.md`
2. Reinstall Python 3.12 or 3.13
3. Try again

### If port 5000 is busy:
1. Run: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000` (shows what's using it)
2. Close that application
3. Try again
